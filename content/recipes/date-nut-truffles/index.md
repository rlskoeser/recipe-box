ingredients:
- 10 pitted dates
- 1 Tbsp coconut oil
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2/4 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. cashew or almond butter
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/2 - 3/4 c. almond flour

directions:
- Process **dates**, **coconut oil**, and **water** in food processor until very small or starts to form a paste.
- Add **cocoa powder**, **nut butter**, **vanilla**, and **salt** and blend to combine.
- Add **almond flour** in 1/4 c. increments until the mixture forms a ball. Scrape the sides as needed. If you add too much flour, add a little more water.
- Scoop the mixture into balls and place on parchment paper. Optionally roll them in almond flour so they look prettier and aren't as sticky.
- Can freeze briefly (15-20 minutes) to make them harder. Store in the refrigerator.
